**Nate Kelley**
<br>Boston, MA

This site is mostly just a home page for various personal projects and a simple web presence with my resume.

I'll probably add some pictures of my dog!

I like (in alphabetical order to imply no particular favoritism - but to also indicate the come-and-go nature of such interests as mere binges for weeks or months or years at a time and stick with you slightly for the rest of your life): 
- audiobooks,
- backpacking,
- baking and baked goods - I ***love*** pastries,
- books - I will never not buy a book or two from the middle section at Brookline Booksmith,
- classical music (and other music too, but its always tied to an exercise context),
- cycling (more of a utility now, I enjoy bike commuting and riding my bike around boston out of the necessity to do so),
- family (#1),
- film photography,
- formula 1,
- going to the art museum
- politics and history,
- running,
- technology (e.g. homelab),
- tennis

among many other things. I like a lot of things. too many to list. and too many fun hobbies that I could never squeeze the time too long past the honeymoon binge. 

I dislike many things too - but don't we all.

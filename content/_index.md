**Nate Kelley**
<br>Boston, MA

This site is mostly just a home page for various personal projects and a simple web presence with my resume.

I'll probably add some pictures of my dog!

I like (in alphabetical order): 
- audiobooks,
- backpacking,
- baking and baked goods  (I ***love*** pastries),
- books (I will never not buy a book or two from the middle section at Brookline Booksmith),
- classical music (and other music too, but in phases -- classical sticks),
- cycling (more of a utility now, I enjoy bike commuting and riding my bike around boston and ***try*** not to drive unless I am going outside the city),
- e-books (all forms of reading baby, give me some literature that I will start and get about 2/3 of the way through set down for an exciting new book and not pick it back up again for another 5 years),
- family,
- film photography,
- formula 1,
- going to the *art museum* (I got the MFA pass, but they're making a couple extra bucks off me)
- going to the **symphony** (at least once a season, but hopefully more),
- hiking (always with the dog! mostly local and up in NH/VT/ME, but my favorite is the local woods where I can put together a nice 10k+ without signficant crossed paths and lots of unmarked trails waiting to be explored)
- lego cars (I enjoy making them and give them to the kids at extended family xmas -- all boxed up with the stickers on the side)
- parentheses (I will always extend a point for further clarification or comments)
- politics and history,
- puttering around boston -- making up errands to run and chores to do, but really just cycling alongside the river stopping at various places all day for iced coffee and pastries and sandwiches and shopping,
- running,
- shakespeare on the common,
- technology (e.g. homelab),
- tennis,

among many other things. I like a lot of things -- too many to list. and too many fun hobbies that I could never squeeze the time in for too long past the honeymoon binge. 

> *I miss you keyboard building and custom keycap clay sculptures -- but I no longer have the time to individually lube 101 keys and manually place springs and switches and all that, then just to have a faulty PCB. Keyboards have gone mainstream and I can now be a consumer. Although who knows, maybe I'll swap out the switches, maybe some different keycaps, maybe a custom keycap or two. All it takes is a spark*

I dislike many things too - but don't we all.

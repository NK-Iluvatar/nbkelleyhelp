**Nate Kelley**
<br>Boston, MA

This site is mostly for documentation for my personal projects and tech stack as well as a simple web presence.

I like:
- photography, 
- running/cycling, 
- backpacking, 
- classical music, 
- politics and history, 
- F1, 
- technology, 
- books (although these days mostly audiobooks, I admit), 
- going to the art museum
- digital media. some gaming, but its mostly the city/civ builders. 

I like to self-host much of my digital presence as it keeps much of my personal data private from advertisers and data brokers. This also allows me to practice my career skills through the homelab.

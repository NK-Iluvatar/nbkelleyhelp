We are going to raffle the thinkpads (maybe the other PC's). They run Windows 11 terrible, but do pretty decent with linux distos.

I was talking to peter and he literally bought a T480 and I was like no dude, we have these and we don't want them and to ask Craig. We gave one to him and then decided to give away the rest too. I grabbed one for granddad. 

Rest of the day was normal. 

A. hmm. Might've overdid it talking to her a lot today, but shes cute. She seems single. What she actually said was "I live alone". but she hasnt mentioned anyone yet. And she also asked me if I was bringing anyone, which everyone knows is a question to ask whether I am single. sooo maybe. We are kinda vibing. 

And she was competent enough to open her PC and uplug the battery. but, ya know, lawyer... idk. 

ANKER Prime dock arrived in the mail.

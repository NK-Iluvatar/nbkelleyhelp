Anotha one. 

Took the day remote (as is my normal remote day)

But tonight is the work holiday party. I'll go. But I'll probably uber. It's not convenient enough for the green line and cycling in the dark with nice clothes is silly. 

I really don't want to go. but I do a little. Maybe to see Adriana - lay on the charm, maybe to hangout a bit with Craig and Peter. But oof, not thrilled.

Adriana is consuming my thoughts a bit. But I am in a better spot than when I had previous interests. But, I need to keep harvesting friendship connections so that I don't become overly focused. See like with Takii, idk something isn't quite right. The spark is there a bit, from time to time, but there's just the hint of "well we would have some good sex and a few passionate months of secrecy, but we would get on each other's nerves". With Adriana there's not enough info to tell. It's that blindness of being in the early stages of a crush before knowing someone. But thats a bit thrilling. And I'm getting some butterflies which is adorable, both nervous and comfortable. its a good vibe. We will see where it goes.

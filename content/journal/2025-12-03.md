Normal day at work but jeez Rick is just hounding me about these signatures that I did not have a part in. Lots of data cleanup from that. 

Brought back the BIOS supervisor password enabled PC and got another one. It seems like such a waste to throw ChromeOS onto a thinkpad. But its old and was going to be recyled anyway.

Stuffed Bell Peppers at G&G's with Ellen tonight. Ellen made it. Ground beef, leftover quinoa some other stuff, spices in bell peppers. Good shit

ChromeOS wouldnt install so I needed to take the thinkpad home. 
...some troubleshooting later

ChromeOS installed after using a different usb stick and mashing the clicky buttons when the OS was loading. Yay it works, but no android apps. I read that there may be a way around that. tbd

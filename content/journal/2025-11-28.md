Solid day.  Black Friday. 

I bought (in-person): 
- Inland Dual 4k Display KVM Switch Dock - regret purchasing it. It does not suit my needs. 
- USB A hub with dual usb C - was slow when jury rigged witht he other ethernet adapter. 
- Coaxial cable kit for stripping/reterminating - will see how this goes. I think itll be fine. Although since I am already receiving basically the full maximum internet connection that I am paying for it may not be needed, but perhaps I am getting the full connection, but it is busy/not clean? 
- More Ethernet crowns? The plastic bit at the end. 
- Maddie advent calendar
- Black Celtics Hat

Bought online (later):
- 2x usb-A 2.5 gbe ethernet adapters - Only had previously bought the usb c
- Christmas Eve gift
	- 1 ANKER Battery
	- 2x Cables
	- 1 ANKER Fast Charger
- Reading light around the neck - grammy
- Kindle Colorsoft - might as well check it out

Idea: 
- Eventually practice K8s by using raspberry pi's. 4's maybe 5's. Test out hosting a full web package on it.

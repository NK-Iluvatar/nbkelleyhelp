Let's make it through the day without thinking about some random person whom I'm not going to see again for like a month. Should I have got her number or will absence make the heart grow fonder. Does that only apply when you know someone truly?

It is now the end of the day and I could not in fact stop thinking about her. 

I am looking forward to tomorrow when I hang out with grammy for a few hours.

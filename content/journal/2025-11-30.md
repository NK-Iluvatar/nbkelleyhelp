# Granddad needed to get downstairs

Granddad is a bit loopy but was better this AM. 

Rosemary had a 10miler. Came over after. 

Called EMS to help him downstairs where we set up the bed. 

Rosemary took grammy to BJ's for some grocery shopping 

All is good. 

Took a vacation day for tomorrow to go over, but to also recover a bit of my lost weekend.
